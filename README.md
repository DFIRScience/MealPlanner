## MealPlanner

A meal planning and grocery list generator to keep #DFIRFIT

Digital forensic investigators and incident responders don't have a lot of time. And very often, the first things that get cut from our schedules are good food and exercise. Cooking at home is a great way to save money and be healthy, but pre-planning and making sure you have all the ingredients is difficult and time-consuming.

MealPlanner is a simple, command-line based tool that takes in your favorite recipes, randomly generates a weekly meal plan, and provides a corresponding grocery list.
